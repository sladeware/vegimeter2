What is Vegimeter?
------------------

The purpose of the Vegimeter application is to use the minimal amount of energy
to heat a container of potting soil to within a specific temperature range, with
the assumption that the ambient temperature is below the desired range so that
heating the soil is required. This is to provide nearly ideal soil temperature
to plants' roots so as to optimize their nutrient transport.
